Please create a web page that has a 4x4 grid, with a border around it. The grid should be horizontally centered in the web page. Every 250 milliseconds, one of the eligible squares should be randomly selected to change colors. Squares are eligible for a color change if its color has not changed in the last two seconds.

Also, do not use any libraries (e.g. jQuery).

We encourage you to spend some time to verify the logic in your solution.

[x] - border
[x] - centered, horizontally
[ ] - 4 x 4 grid
